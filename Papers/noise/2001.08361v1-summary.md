# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Empirical scaling laws reveal that language model performance improves predictably with model size, dataset size, and compute power, highlighting the importance of optimal compute-efficient training strategies.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Language model performance scales as a power-law with model size, dataset size, and compute used.
2. Network width or depth have minimal effects within a wide range.
3. Simple equations govern overfitting and training speed dependencies.
4. Optimal compute-efficient training involves large models with moderate data, stopping before convergence.
5. Larger models are significantly more sample-efficient.
6. Overfitting depends predictably on the ratio of model size to dataset size.
7. Training curves follow predictable power-laws, allowing loss prediction.
8. Transfer performance correlates strongly with in-distribution validation results.
9. Ideal batch size is roughly determined by the loss and gradient noise scale.
10. Larger models require fewer samples and optimization steps to achieve the same performance.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Larger language models will continue to perform better and be more sample efficient.
2. Optimal compute-efficient training involves using very large models and stopping short of convergence.
3. Performance improvements are smooth and predictable across model size, dataset size, and compute.
4. Overfitting can be managed by scaling dataset size sub-linearly with model size.
5. Predictable power-law trends can guide the allocation of compute resources for optimal performance.
