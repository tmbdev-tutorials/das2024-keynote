## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The study introduces ReaLMistake, a benchmark for detecting diverse and realistic errors in LLM responses, revealing LLMs' low recall and unreliable error explanations.

## MAIN POINTS:
1. ReaLMistake is the first error detection benchmark with objective and diverse LLM errors.
2. It includes tasks on reasoning correctness, instruction-following, context-faithfulness, and parameterized knowledge.
3. GPT-4 and Llama 2 70B responses were annotated by experts.
4. Evaluations show top LLMs detect errors with very low recall compared to humans.
5. LLM-based error detectors' explanations are often unreliable.
6. Error detection performance is sensitive to small prompt changes.
7. Popular techniques like self-consistency and majority vote do not improve error detection.
8. ReaLMistake includes 900 instances from three tasks: Math Word Problem Generation, Fine-grained Fact Verification, and Answerability Classification.
9. The study highlights the need for further research to improve LLM-based error detectors.
10. Detailed instructions ensure tasks are objectively evaluated without subjectivity.

## TAKEAWAYS:
1. LLMs struggle with error detection, often performing worse than random baselines.
2. Explanations provided by LLMs for error detection lack reliability.
3. Small changes in prompts significantly affect error detection recall.
4. Existing popular techniques fail to enhance LLM-based error detection performance.
5. ReaLMistake provides a comprehensive benchmark for advancing LLM error detection research.
