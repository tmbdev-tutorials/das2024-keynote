# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The study evaluates the resilience of large language models (LLMs) to various types of noise in instructions and explores strategies for improving their performance.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Large language models (LLMs) are tested for resilience against five common types of noise.
2. Types of noise include ASR errors, OCR errors, grammatical mistakes, typographical errors, and distractive content.
3. Over 40% of user inputs contain typographical errors, grammatical mistakes, or unrelated content.
4. LLMs show higher resilience to grammatical mistakes due to their presence in training data.
5. ASR and OCR errors pose significant challenges as they are less common in training datasets.
6. Distractive content from past interactions can lead to deviations in responses.
7. The "re-pass" strategy involves purifying noisy instructions before processing them with LLMs.
8. ChatGPT shows a strong capability in correcting noisy instructions, unlike some open-source models.
9. Performance declines with increasing word error rate (WER) in noisy instructions.
10. The study emphasizes the need for further model development to handle noisy data effectively.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. LLMs need improved strategies to handle ASR and OCR errors effectively.
2. Grammatical mistakes are less detrimental to LLM performance compared to other noise types.
3. The "re-pass" strategy can significantly improve the processing of noisy instructions.
4. Models like ChatGPT are more effective in correcting noisy instructions than many open-source models.
5. Developing LLMs that can filter out irrelevant content from past interactions is crucial.
