# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The paper introduces the PubTabNet dataset and a novel EDD model for improved image-based table recognition, outperforming existing methods.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. PubTabNet dataset includes 568k table images with HTML annotations.
2. Tables extracted from PMCOA scientific articles in PDF format.
3. EDD architecture features an encoder, structure decoder, and cell decoder.
4. Structure decoder reconstructs table structure aiding cell content recognition.
5. New Tree-Edit-Distance-based Similarity (TEDS) metric proposed for evaluation.
6. EDD model achieves 9.7% higher TEDS score than state-of-the-art.
7. Evaluation shows EDD model's superior performance on complex tables.
8. PubTabNet dataset offers diverse table styles from over 6,000 journals.
9. EDD model trained on PubTabNet demonstrates high accuracy in table recognition.
10. EDD model's dual decoders enhance performance over single decoder models.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. PubTabNet is the largest dataset for image-based table recognition.
2. EDD model significantly outperforms existing table recognition methods.
3. TEDS metric better captures table structure and OCR errors.
4. Dual decoder approach in EDD improves table structure and content recognition.
5. PubTabNet's diversity enhances model robustness and generalizability.
