# Introduction

- OCR (Optical Character Recognition) recognizes text in images automatically
- Wide range of applications: document electronization, identity authentication, digital financial systems, and vehicle license plate recognition
- Challenges: various text appearances and computational efficiency

# Problem Statement and Motivation

- OCR systems are used in many applications but face challenges due to diverse text appearances and computational demands
- Need for a lightweight and efficient OCR system

# Scope of the Paper

- Propose a practical ultra lightweight OCR system, PP-OCR
- Model size: 3.5M for 6622 Chinese characters, 2.8M for 63 alphanumeric symbols
- Introduce strategies to enhance model ability and reduce size
- Provide ablation experiments and pre-trained models

# Key Contributions

- Development of PP-OCR, an ultra lightweight OCR system
- Introduction of strategies to balance model size and performance
- Open-sourcing models and codes on GitHub

# Methodology Overview

- PP-OCR consists of three parts: text detection, detected boxes rectification, and text recognition
- Use of Differentiable Binarization (DB) for text detection
- Use of geometric transformation for detected boxes rectification
- Use of CRNN for text recognition

# Text Detection

- Locate text area in the image
- Use Differentiable Binarization (DB) based on a simple segmentation network
- Strategies to improve efficiency: light backbone, light head, remove SE module, cosine learning rate decay, learning rate warm-up, FPGM pruner

# Detected Boxes Rectification

- Transform detected text boxes into horizontal rectangles
- Use a classifier to determine text direction and correct reversed boxes
- Strategies: light backbone, data augmentation, input resolution, PACT quantization

# Text Recognition

- Use CRNN (Connectionist Temporal Classification) for text recognition
- Integrates feature extraction and sequence modeling
- Strategies: light backbone, data augmentation, cosine learning rate decay, feature map resolution, regularization parameters, learning rate warm-up, light head, pre-trained model, PACT quantization

# Datasets

- Constructed large-scale dataset for Chinese and English recognition
- Text detection: 97K training images, 500 validation images
- Direction classification: 600K training images, 310K validation images
- Text recognition: 17.9M training images, 18.7K validation images

# Experiments

- Ablation experiments to evaluate strategies
- Comparison of different backbones and configurations
- Evaluation metrics: HMean, accuracy, F-score

# Performance Comparisons with Prior Work

- Comparison with large-scale OCR systems
- Ultra lightweight system shows better model size and inference time with competitive F-score

# Results

- PP-OCR achieves a balance between model size and performance
- Effective strategies for enhancing model ability and reducing size
- Open-sourced models verified for multiple languages

# Conclusion

- Summary of contributions: development of PP-OCR, strategies for model enhancement and slimming, open-sourcing models
