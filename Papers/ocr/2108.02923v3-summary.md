# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
StrucTexT introduces a unified framework leveraging multi-modal transformers for structured text understanding, excelling in entity labeling and linking tasks on visually rich documents.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. StrucTexT addresses entity labeling and linking tasks in VRDs.
2. Utilizes a segment-token aligned encoder for multi-granularity tasks.
3. Introduces three self-supervised pre-training tasks for richer representation.
4. Combines text, image, and layout information.
5. Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on FUNSD, SROIE, and EPHOIE datasets.
6. Pre-training tasks include Masked Visual Language Modeling, Sentence Length Prediction, and Paired Boxes Direction.
7. Uses a transformer encoder inspired by vision-language transformers.
8. Incorporates segment ID embedding for visual-text alignment.
9. Evaluates model on three benchmark datasets.
10. Demonstrates superior performance and significant improvements in document understanding tasks.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. StrucTexT's unified framework effectively handles both token-level and segment-level tasks.
2. Novel pre-training strategies enhance multi-modal feature representation.
3. Segment ID embedding facilitates better visual-text alignment.
4. The model significantly improves entity labeling and linking performance.
5. Extensive experiments validate StrucTexT's superior performance over existing methods.
