# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
GraphDoc, a multimodal graph attention-based model, integrates text, layout, and image information for superior document understanding tasks.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Document intelligence automates reading, understanding, and analyzing documents.
2. GraphDoc is a multimodal graph attention-based model for document understanding.
3. Integrates text, layout, and image information in a multimodal framework.
4. Each input node attends only to its neighborhoods in the graph attention layer.
5. Multimodal feature fusion is performed by the gate fusion layer.
6. Pre-trained on 320k unlabeled documents via Masked Sentence Modeling task.
7. GraphDoc achieves state-of-the-art performance on publicly available datasets.
8. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphDoc.
9. GraphDoc reduces learning cost compared to Transformer architecture.
10. Code is available at https://github.com/ZZR8066/GraphDoc.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. GraphDoc leverages text, layout, and image information for document understanding.
2. Graph attention layer enables local and global contextualization.
3. Achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple document understanding tasks.
4. Pre-training with only 320k documents is effective.
5. Gate fusion layer efficiently combines multimodal features.
