# Introduction
- OCR technology has various applications: document electronization, identity authentication, digital financial systems, vehicle license plate recognition
- Need for practical OCR systems with high accuracy and computational efficiency
- Previous systems: PP-OCR and PP-OCRv2

# Background/Related Work
- Previous work proposed PP-OCR and optimized version PP-OCRv2
- PP-OCRv2 improved accuracy without increasing prediction cost
- Persistent issues: missed detection of single words, misrecognition

# Contributions
- Propose PP-OCRv3, a more robust OCR system
- Upgrades text detection and recognition models in 9 aspects
- Open-sourced models and code available in PaddleOCR GitHub repository

# Objective
- Improve performance of PP-OCRv2
- Address issues of missed detections and misrecognition

# Methodology Overview
- High-Level Overview: PP-OCRv3 framework similar to PP-OCRv2
- Text detection: Optimized DB model with new modules
- Text recognition: New lightweight network SVTR-LCNet

# Datasets
- Text Detection: 127k training images (68k real, 59k synthetic), 200 validation images
- Text Recognition: 18.5M training images (7M real, 11.5M synthetic), 18.7K validation images
- Additional 800 images for end-to-end system evaluation

# Model Details
## Text Detection
- LK-PAN: Large Kernel PAN module for better receptive field
