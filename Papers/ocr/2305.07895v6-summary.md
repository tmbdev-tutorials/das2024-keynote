# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Large multimodal models show promise in text-related visual tasks but face challenges in handwritten, multilingual, and complex text recognition.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Large models dominate NLP and multimodal vision-language learning.
2. OCRBench evaluates OCR capabilities of large multimodal models.
3. OCRBench includes 29 datasets, making it the most comprehensive OCR benchmark.
4. Models show strengths and weaknesses in multilingual, handwritten, and mathematical text.
5. Even state-of-the-art models struggle with blurry, non-semantic text, and handwritten expressions.
6. Proposed OCRBench can guide improvements in multimodal techniques.
7. Evaluation pipeline and benchmark available on GitHub.
8. LMMs achieve promising results in text recognition but struggle with domain-specific tasks.
9. Future research should enhance fine-grain perception and multilingual datasets.
10. LMMs' OCR capabilities can be improved through domain-specific adaptations and optimizations.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Large multimodal models are effective but have limitations in complex text recognition.
2. OCRBench is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating OCR capabilities.
3. Fine-grain perception and semantic reliance are key areas for improvement.
4. High-resolution input is crucial for better performance in detailed text tasks.
5. Enhancing OCR capabilities in LMMs requires domain-specific adaptations and more diverse training data.
