# Introduction

- Problem: Poor performance of visual document classifiers on out-of-distribution (OOD) data
- Motivation: Need for models that generalize well to unseen document layouts
- Scope: Propose GVdoc, a graph-based document classification model

# Background/Related Work

- Previous Work: CNNs and Transformer-based models
- Limitations: High computational demand, poor OOD performance
- Key Concepts: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Optical Character Recognition (OCR)

# Contributions

- Introduce graph-based document modeling using layout and reading order
- Demonstrate improved OOD performance with fewer parameters
- Show robustness to OCR errors

# Objective

- Main Objective: Develop a document classification model that performs well on OOD data
- Research Questions: Can graph-based models improve OOD performance?

# Methodology Overview

- Approach: Generate a document graph from OCR data and train a GNN
- Data Used: RVLCDIP, RN, RO datasets
- Model Architecture: Combines β-skeleton and paragraph-based edges

# Datasets

- RVLCDIP: In-distribution dataset with 320,000 training samples
- RN: OOD but in-domain dataset with 1,002 documents
- RO: OOD and out-of-domain dataset with 3,415 samples
- Data Preprocessing: Use Tesseract OCR for text and layout extraction

# Model Details

- Model Architecture: Graph Attention Network (GAT)
- Key Layers: Text and layout embedding layers, feature fusion module
- Training Procedure: Pre-training on IITCDIP, fine-tuning on RVLCDIP

# Experiments

- Experimental Setup: Compared GVdoc with CNNs and Transformer-based models
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, AUC, FPR95

# Results

- Performance Metrics: GVdoc shows higher accuracy on RN and lower FPR95 on RO
- Key Findings: GVdoc outperforms state-of-the-art models on OOD data

# Performance Comparisons with Prior Work

- Baselines: VGG-16, GoogLeNet, DiT, LayoutLMv2, LayoutLMv3
- Performance Gains: GVdoc achieves better generalization with fewer parameters
- Trade-offs: Improved OOD performance with comparable in-distribution accuracy

# Ablation Studies

- Graph Generation: Combined β-skeleton and paragraph-based graph shows best performance
- Neighbors per Token: Optimal number of neighbors improves OOD accuracy

# Discussion

- Key Insights: Graph-based approach leverages document layout effectively
- Interpretation of Results: Robust to OCR errors, better OOD performance
- Limitations: Relies on OCR quality, lacks visual features

# Conclusion

- Summary of Contributions: Introduced GVdoc, demonstrated superior OOD performance
- Impact of Findings: Potential for real-world applications with diverse document layouts
- Future Work Directions: Integrate visual features, explore other graph generation methods
