## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The paper presents a Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) method that enhances language models' performance in classifying logical fallacies through retrieval and adaptation of similar past cases.

## MAIN POINTS:
1. Misinformation and propaganda spread necessitate reliable technology for detecting fallacies in natural language arguments.
2. Current language models struggle with logical fallacy classification due to complex reasoning requirements.
3. The proposed CBR method classifies fallacies by retrieving and adapting historical cases using language models.
4. Four strategies enrich input representation: counterarguments, goals, explanations, and argument structure.
5. Experiments show CBR improves accuracy and generalizability in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings.
6. Ablation studies reveal that fewer retrieved cases and similar case representations significantly impact performance.
7. The size of the case database has a negligible effect on model performance.
8. CBR consistently outperforms vanilla language models and few-shot Codex in logical fallacy classification.
9. Enriching cases with counterarguments yields the highest performance boost among the four strategies.
10. Future work should explore CBR's application in other tasks requiring abstract reasoning and causal relations.

## TAKEAWAYS:
1. CBR enhances language models' accuracy and explainability in logical fallacy classification.
2. Counterarguments as an enrichment strategy significantly improve model performance.
3. The method is effective with a small case database and performs best with fewer retrieved cases.
4. The CBR framework generalizes well to unseen data and various fallacy classes.
5. Qualitative analysis shows that retrieved similar cases assist indirectly, requiring further reasoning steps.
