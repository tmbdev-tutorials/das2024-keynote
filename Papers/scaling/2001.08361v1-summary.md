# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Language model performance scales predictably with model size, dataset size, and compute, showing power-law trends across several orders of magnitude.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Model performance depends most strongly on scale, involving model size, dataset size, and compute used for training.
2. Performance has a power-law relationship with each of the three scale factors when not bottlenecked by the others.
3. Overfitting is predictable and scales with the ratio of model size to dataset size.
4. Training curves follow predictable power-laws, largely independent of model size.
5. Transfer performance improves in line with training performance, with a constant offset in loss.
6. Larger models are more sample-efficient, requiring fewer optimization steps and data points.
7. Compute-efficient training involves large models trained on modest data, stopping before convergence.
8. The optimal batch size for training is determined by measuring gradient noise scale.
9. The power-law scalings apply universally within a wide range of model architectures and sizes.
10. Scaling laws suggest that larger language models will continue to improve performance and sample efficiency.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Larger models trained on modest datasets with significant compute efficiency outperform smaller models.
2. Overfitting can be controlled by scaling dataset size sublinearly with model size.
3. The optimal training strategy involves balancing model size, batch size, and training steps.
4. The critical batch size grows predictably with performance, independent of model size.
5. Universal power-law trends across model size, dataset size, and compute provide a framework for optimizing language model training.
