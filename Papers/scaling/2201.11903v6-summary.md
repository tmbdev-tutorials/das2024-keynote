### ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Chain-of-thought prompting significantly enhances large language models' reasoning abilities by breaking down complex problems into intermediate steps.

### MAIN POINTS:
1. Chain-of-thought prompting involves providing intermediate reasoning steps in prompts.
2. Experiments show notable improvements in arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks.
3. PaLM 540B achieved state-of-the-art performance on the GSM8K benchmark using chain-of-thought prompting.
4. Large language models can naturally develop reasoning abilities with sufficient scale.
5. Chain-of-thought prompting is effective for few-shot learning without extensive training data.
6. The method allows the model to allocate more computation to multi-step problems.
7. It provides an interpretable way to understand model behavior and debug reasoning paths.
8. Chain-of-thought reasoning is robust to various annotators and prompt styles.
9. Empirical results demonstrate significant gains over standard prompting methods.
10. This approach is applicable across diverse reasoning tasks that humans solve via language.

### TAKEAWAYS:
