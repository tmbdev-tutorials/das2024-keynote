# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Scaling large language models can lead to emergent abilities that are unpredictable and not present in smaller models.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Emergent abilities are those not seen in smaller models but appear in larger ones.
2. Scaling laws predict performance improvements for many tasks but not for emergent abilities.
3. Few-shot prompting shows emergent abilities at certain scales.
4. Augmented prompting strategies, like chain-of-thought, also show emergent effects.
5. Emergent abilities often appear after crossing a critical threshold of model scale.
6. Emergent behaviors are seen in diverse tasks like arithmetic, language understanding, and reasoning.
7. Scaling compute, model parameters, and dataset size contributes to emergent abilities.
8. Emergent abilities raise questions about future scaling and model capabilities.
9. Some tasks remain challenging and are potential candidates for future emergence.
10. Emergent risks, like biases and toxicity, also increase with model scale.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Emergent abilities cannot be predicted by smaller models' performance.
2. Scaling up models can unpredictably unlock new capabilities.
3. Few-shot prompting is a key area where emergent abilities are observed.
4. Additional research is needed to understand and predict emergent abilities.
5. Future scaling and improvements in data and training may lower the threshold for emergent abilities.
