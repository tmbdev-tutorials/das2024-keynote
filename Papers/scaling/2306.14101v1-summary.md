# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Large language models (LLMs) can serve as weak learners in boosting algorithms for tabular data, outperforming traditional methods in some cases.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Weak learners achieve better-than-random performance on any data distribution.
2. Prompt-based LLMs can function as weak learners.
3. LLMs summarize tabular data samples for classification tasks.
4. LLM-based boosting can outperform tree-based boosting in certain settings.
5. The approach outperforms zero-shot and few-shot learning without retraining the LLM.
6. LLMs are integrated into boosting frameworks without access to gradients or internal states.
7. Data descriptions from LLMs are used as prompts for classification.
8. Summarization of data descriptions serves as weak learners for boosting.
9. The method is effective particularly for small datasets.
10. The boosting approach leverages LLMs' prior knowledge for improved performance.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. LLMs can be effectively used in machine learning pipelines beyond few-shot learning.
2. Boosting with LLMs can outperform traditional methods, especially for small datasets.
3. Properly sampled text descriptions of tabular data are crucial for LLM performance.
4. LLM-based methods do not require retraining, making them efficient.
5. The method highlights the potential of LLMs in broader machine learning applications.
