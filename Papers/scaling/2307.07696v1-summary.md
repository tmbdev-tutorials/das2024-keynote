# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:

Combining large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 with logic programming enhances reasoning from text, enabling robust, general, and interpretable question-answering across multiple tasks without extensive retraining.

# MAIN POINTS:

1. Large language models (LLMs) excel as few-shot semantic parsers for converting text into logical forms.
2. Combining LLMs with answer set programming (ASP) improves robustness and general reasoning.
3. The approach handles multiple question-answering tasks without retraining.
4. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like bAbI, StepGame, CLUTRR, and gSCAN.
5. The system also tackles robot planning tasks that LLMs alone cannot solve.
6. LLMs provide rich semantic knowledge but struggle with deep reasoning and consistency.
7. ASP provides interpretable and explainable reasoning using background knowledge.
8. Few-shot prompts and reusable ASP knowledge modules are key to the methodâ€™s success.
9. The system can identify dataset errors, serving as a validation tool.
10. The approach integrates neural and symbolic reasoning effectively for various NLP tasks.

# TAKEAWAYS:

1. Combining LLMs with ASP leads to robust and interpretable reasoning systems.
2. The method achieves high accuracy on multiple NLP benchmarks without extensive retraining.
3. LLMs are effective semantic parsers but need ASP for complex reasoning.
4. The system can detect and correct errors in datasets, enhancing data quality.
5. Few-shot prompts and reusable knowledge modules significantly reduce the need for training data.
