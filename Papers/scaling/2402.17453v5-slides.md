# Introduction

- Investigates the potential of large language models (LLMs) to automate data science tasks
- Goal: Comprehending task requirements, building, and training the best-fit machine learning models
- Existing LLM agents struggle with generating reasonable experiment plans
- DS-Agent: A novel framework utilizing LLM agents and case-based reasoning (CBR)

# Background/Related Work

- LLMs empowered autonomous agents to address various tasks (OpenAI, 2022; 2023)
- Current agents like AutoGPT and LangChain struggle in data science scenarios (Huang et al., 2023)
- Kaggle as a resource for expert knowledge in data science
- Case-Based Reasoning (CBR): Solving new tasks by adapting past solutions (Kolodner, 1992; Watson & Marir, 1994)

# Contributions

- Introduction of DS-Agent, combining LLM agents with CBR
- Automatic iteration pipeline for consistent performance improvement
