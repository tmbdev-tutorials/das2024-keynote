# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
DS-Agent, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Case-Based Reasoning (CBR), automates data science tasks by iteratively refining models using expert insights from Kaggle.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. DS-Agent automates data science by comprehending tasks and building/training machine learning models.
2. Existing LLM agents struggle with generating reasonable experiment plans.
3. DS-Agent employs a CBR framework to structure an automatic iteration pipeline.
4. Kaggle’s expert knowledge is utilized to improve performance through feedback mechanisms.
5. DS-Agent achieves a 100% success rate in the development stage with GPT-4.
6. In deployment, DS-Agent adapts past solutions for direct code generation, reducing LLM demands.
7. DS-Agent significantly reduces resource costs in low-resource scenarios.
8. Empirical results show DS-Agent’s superiority across 30 data science tasks.
9. DS-Agent’s flexible learning mechanism avoids resource-intensive LLM finetuning.
10. Open-source data and code are available at https://github.com/guosyjlu/DS-Agent.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. DS-Agent integrates LLMs and CBR to consistently improve machine learning model performance.
2. Kaggle insights are pivotal in structuring effective experiment plans.
3. The framework operates in both development and low-resource deployment stages.
4. DS-Agent offers significant cost savings in real-world deployment scenarios.
5. The framework demonstrates robust performance across diverse data science tasks.
