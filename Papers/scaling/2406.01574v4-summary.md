# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
MMLU-Pro introduces a more challenging language understanding benchmark with complex, reasoning-focused questions and increased answer options, improving model differentiation and stability.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. MMLU-Pro enhances the MMLU benchmark with reasoning-focused questions.
2. Expands answer choices from four to ten, increasing difficulty.
3. Removes trivial and noisy questions from the original MMLU.
4. Causes a significant accuracy drop, ranging from 16% to 33%.
5. Demonstrates greater stability under varying prompts, reducing sensitivity to prompt variations to 2%.
6. Models using Chain of Thought reasoning perform better on MMLU-Pro.
7. Evaluates over 50 language models, both open-source and closed-source.
8. GPT-4o achieves a top accuracy of 72.6% on MMLU-Pro.
9. Highlights the need for deliberate reasoning, unlike the knowledge-driven MMLU.
10. Confirms MMLU-Pro as a more discriminative benchmark for tracking progress in language models.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. MMLU-Pro significantly raises the challenge level for language models.
2. Increasing answer options enhances benchmark robustness.
3. Chain of Thought reasoning is crucial for better performance on MMLU-Pro.
4. The benchmark is more discriminative, effectively distinguishing between models.
5. MMLU-Pro provides a stable and reliable evaluation tool for future advancements in language models.
