# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Large language models often make factual errors due to co-occurrence bias, favoring frequently co-occurring words over accurate answers.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. LLMs frequently produce factually incorrect responses.
2. Co-occurrence bias is a significant cause of these errors.
3. LLMs struggle with facts where subject and object rarely co-occur.
4. Scaling up model sizes or finetuning does not resolve co-occurrence bias.
5. Debiased finetuning can help LLMs memorize rare facts seen during training.
6. Debiased finetuning is ineffective for rare facts not seen during training.
7. Co-occurrence statistics can inflate perceived model performance.
8. Heavily relying on co-occurrence leads to hallucinations and biased responses.
9. Future research should focus on mitigating co-occurrence bias.
10. Findings suggest a need for more reliable language models.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Co-occurrence bias causes LLMs to favor frequently co-occurring words over correct answers.
2. Increasing model size or finetuning improves performance but does not eliminate co-occurrence bias.
3. Debiased finetuning helps with memorizing rare facts seen during training.
4. Co-occurrence statistics can mislead evaluations of model accuracy.
5. Future work should aim to mitigate co-occurrence bias for more accurate and reliable models.
