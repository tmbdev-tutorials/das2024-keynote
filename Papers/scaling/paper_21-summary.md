# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Case Based Reasoning (CBR) can enhance Large Language Models' (LLMs) accuracy, interpretability, and explainability, thereby improving user trust in AI.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. LLMs often make factual errors and hallucinate, affecting user trust.
2. Trust in AI is crucial due to its increasing integration into daily life.
3. Case Based Reasoning (CBR) uses concrete episodes to improve AI interpretability.
4. CBR is similar to human episodic memory, unlike RAG which is like semantic memory.
5. LLMs benefit from integrating external knowledge for better performance.
6. Improving LLM accuracy and explainability can enhance user trust.
7. Research stages include testing case-augmented generation and examining user trust.
8. Human studies show that case-based explanations increase trust in AI.
9. Initial experiments show CBR can outperform baseline LLM performance.
10. Future research will focus on handling partial information and lack of class representation.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. CBR can make LLMs more interpretable and explainable, enhancing user trust.
2. Integrating case knowledge into LLMs improves their accuracy.
3. Human trust in AI increases with transparent, case-based explanations.
4. LLM performance can be enhanced by adapting to case-based scenarios.
5. Future research will address LLM behavior under incomplete data conditions.
