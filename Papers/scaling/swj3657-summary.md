# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The paper proposes a novel scientific publishing workflow called SemPubFlow using knowledge graphs, Wikidata, and large language models to modernize and streamline the CEUR-WS publication process.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. CEUR-WS platform has been crucial for scientific workshop and conference proceedings since 1995.
2. The traditional publishing workflow is manual, redundant, and burdensome for CEUR-WS editors.
3. SemPubFlow introduces a FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) knowledge graph approach.
4. Transition strategy avoids a "big bang" approach to ensure continuity and integrity.
5. Metadata-first publishing enhances the quality and availability of data early in the event lifecycle.
6. The approach leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Wikidata for metadata extraction and linking.
7. Persistent Identifiers (PIDs) are recommended for disambiguation of core entities.
8. The SemPubFlow tool assists in metadata collection from event homepages.
9. Legal aspects of publishing personal data are addressed through consent and compliance.
10. Future work aims to integrate SemPubFlow with other publishing outlets and enhance automation.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. SemPubFlow aims to modernize and streamline the CEUR-WS publication process by using knowledge graphs and LLMs.
2. Early and consistent use of PIDs is crucial for metadata quality and disambiguation.
3. The workflow separates metadata storage from content display, enhancing flexibility and scalability.
4. LLMs can effectively extract event metadata, reducing manual effort and errors.
5. Legal compliance and stakeholder involvement are essential for successful implementation.
