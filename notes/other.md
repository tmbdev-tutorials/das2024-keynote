Neural mass models (NMMs) are designed to reproduce the collective dynamics of
neuronal populations. A common framework for NMMs assumes heuristically that the
output firing rate of a neural population can be described by a static nonlinear
transfer function (NMM1). However, a recent exact mean-field theory for
quadratic integrate-and-fire (QIF) neurons challenges this view by showing that
the mean firing rate is not a static function of the neuronal state but follows
two coupled nonlinear differential equations (NMM2). Here we analyze and compare
these two descriptions in the presence of second-order synaptic dynamics. First,
we derive the mathematical equivalence between the two models in the infinitely
slow synapse limit, i.e., we show that NMM1 is an approximation of NMM2 in this
regime. Next, we evaluate the applicability of this limit in the context of
realistic physiological parameter values by analyzing the dynamics of models
with inhibitory or excitatory synapses. We show that NMM1 fails to reproduce
important dynamical features of the exact model, such as the self-sustained
oscillations of an inhibitory interneuron QIF network. Furthermore, in the exact
model but not in the limit one, stimulation of a pyramidal cell population
induces resonant oscillatory activity whose peak frequency and amplitude
increase with the self-coupling gain and the external excitatory input. This may
play a role in the enhanced response of densely connected networks to weak
uniform inputs, such as the electric fields produced by non-invasive brain
stimulation.

Bicknell and Häusser develop a theoretical approach for investigating single-

Year: 2021

Since its beginning in the 1950s, the field of artificial intelligence has
cycled several times between periods of optimistic predictions and massive
investment ('AI spring') and periods of disappointment, loss of confidence, and
reduced funding ('AI winter'). Even with today’s seemingly fast pace of AI
breakthroughs, the development of long-promised technologies such as self-
driving cars, housekeeping robots, and conversational companions has turned out
to be much harder than many people expected. One reason for these repeating
cycles is our limited understanding of the nature and complexity of intelligence
itself. In this paper I describe four fallacies in common assumptions made by AI
researchers, which can lead to overconfident predictions about the field. I
conclude by discussing the open questions spurred by these fallacies, including
the age-old challenge of imbuing machines with humanlike common sense.

## A two-compartment model of synaptic computation and plasticity

Keywords: synaptic computation, synaptic plasticity, two-compartment model, presynaptic function, postsynaptic function
Year: 2020

The synapse is typically viewed as a single compartment, which acts as a linear
gain controller on incoming input. Traditional plasticity rules enable this gain
control to be dynamically optimized by Hebbian activity. Whilst this view nicely
captures postsynaptic function, it neglects the non-linear dynamics of
presynaptic function. Here we present a two-compartment model of the synapse in
which the presynaptic terminal first acts to filter presynaptic input before the
postsynaptic terminal, acting as a gain controller, amplifies or depresses
transmission. We argue that both compartments are equipped with distinct
plasticity rules to enable them to optimally adapt synaptic transmission to the
statistics of pre- and postsynaptic activity. Specifically, we focus on how
presynaptic plasticity enables presynaptic filtering to be optimally tuned to
only transmit information relevant for postsynaptic firing. We end by discussing
the advantages of having a presynaptic filter and propose future work to explore
presynaptic function and plasticity in vivo.

Year: 2020

On the basis of a theorem, in which an evanescent photon is a superluminal
particle, the author considers the possibility of realizing a high-performance
computer system compared with conventional silicon processors, which can perform
infinite steps of computation within the finite time. This is called a
hypercomputer. This critical component for hypercomputing can be created using
meta-material circuits with a non-linear refractive index. Based on this optical
computer system, utilizing meta-material technology, it can be shown that
superluminal computation, which is a new concept for an accelerated Turing
machine, can be realized in the physical world. This system is related with the
negative entropy which was introduced by Erwin Schrödinger. In this article, the
author shows that negative entropy will appear in the computational steps by
using superluminal particles.

## A General Kinematic Modeling Framework for a 3D Compliant Micromechanism

Keywords: Microrobots, compliant mechanisms, MEMS, simulation
Year: 2020

Exploiting engineering compliance in microrobotics has been a breakthrough
approach for navigating well-known tradeoffs related to precision, fabrication,
and control challenges at small scales. However, modeling of compliant, multi-
body, 3-dimensional microrobots is considerably more difficult than traditional
rigid-body robot kinematics. In this paper, we formulate a kinematic modeling
methodology applicable to a broad class of compliant microrobots. Such models
can be used prior to fabrication to evaluate mechanism dexterity, precision, and
sensitivity to dimensional tolerances. They can also be used for microrobot
visualization, control synthesis, and for fast parametric optimization. We
exemplify our approach by modeling the AFAM, an Articulated Four Axes
Microrobot, constructed via 3D microassembly from Micro Electro Mechanical
System (MEMS) compliant building blocks. The AFAM is a novel mm-scale microrobot
designed for nano-positioning tasks in future wafer-scale microfactories. We
derive the kinematic model of the AFAM using a computationally scalable
constraint optimization approach that can be used equally effectively for both
forward and inverse kinematics. Simulation results using the robot operating
system (ROS) programming framework are presented in the paper.

Year: 2020

We develop a health informatics toolbox that enables public health workers to
timely analyze and evaluate the time-course dynamics of the novel coronavirus
(COVID-19) infection using the publicly available data from the China CDC. This
toolbox is built upon a hierarchical epidemiological model in which two observed
time series of daily proportions of infected and removed cases are emitted from
the underlying infection dynamics governed by a Markov SIR infectious disease
process. We extend the SIR model to incorporate various types of time-varying
quarantine protocols, including government-level macro isolation policies and
community-level micro inspection measures. We develop a calibration procedure
for under-reported infected cases. This toolbox provides forecasts, in both
online and offline forms, of turning points of interest, including the time when
the daily infected proportion becomes smaller than the previous one and the time
when the daily infected proportion becomes smaller than that of the daily
removed proportion, as well as the ending time of the epidemic. An R software is
made available for the public, and examples on the use of this software are
illustrated. Some possible extensions of our novel epidemiological models are
discussed.

Keywords: COVID-19, coronavirus, Italy, prediction, epidemics trend
Year: 2020

Background: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently a global public
health threat. Outside of China, Italy is one of the most suffering countries
with the COVID-19 epidemic. It is important to predict the epidemics trend of
COVID-19 epidemic in Italy to help develop public health strategies. Methods: We
used time-series data of COVID-19 from Jan 22, 2020 to Mar 16, 2020. An
infectious disease dynamic extended susceptible-infected-removed (eSIR) model,
which covers the effects of different intervention measures in dissimilar
periods, was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Italy. The basic
reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and
presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credible interval (CI).
Hunan, with similar total number of populations in Italy, was used as a
comparative item. Results: In the eSIR model, we estimated that the basic
reproductive number for COVID-19 was respectively 4.10 (95% CI: 2.15–6.77) in
Italy and 3.15 (95% CI: 1.71–5.21) in Hunan. There would be totally 30,086
infected cases (95%CI: 7920-81,869) under the current country blockade and the
endpoint would be Apr 25 (95%CI: Mar 30 to Aug 07) in Italy. If the country
blockade is imposed 5 days later, the total number of infected cases would
expand the infection scale 1.50 times. Conclusion: Italy's current strict
measures can efficaciously prevent the further spread of COVID-19 and should be
maintained.

The ability to synthesize complex organic molecules is essential to the

medicines. Despite advances in laboratory automation, the identification and
development of synthetic routes remain a manual process. We describe an approach
toward automated, scalable synthesis that combines techniques in AI for planning
and robotics for execution. Millions of previously published reactions inform
the computational design of synthetic routes; expert-refined chemical recipe
files are run on a robotic flow chemistry platform for scalable, reproducible
synthesis. This development strategy augments a chemist’s ability to approach
target-oriented flow synthesis while substantially reducing the necessary
information gathering and manual effort. The software and platform represent a
milestone on the path toward fully autonomous chemical synthesis, where routes
still require human input and process development.

The ability to compute on encrypted data in a meaningful way is a subject of
increasing interest in both academia and industry. The type of encryption that
allows any function to be evaluated on encrypted data is called fully
homomorphic encryption, or FHE, and is one promising way to achieve secure
computation. The problem was first stated in 1978 by Rivest et al. and first
realized by Gentry in 2009, but remains an open problem since an FHE scheme that
is both efficient and secure is yet to be presented. Most of the prominent FHE
schemes follow Gentry’s blueprint which concentrates the efforts of researchers
on very similar algebraic structures and noise management techniques. The
intrinsic complexity of these schemes results in the similar shortfalls that
they share in efficiency. We introduce the application of Geometric Algebra (GA)
to encryption in conjunction with p-adic arithmetic and a modified version of
the Chinese Remainder Theorem and we demonstrate an efficient, noise-free,
symmetric-key FHE scheme. We focus the security analysis on demonstrating that
our FHE scheme is not linearly decryptable. Further, we discuss a practical
approach for generalizing different types of algebraic structures in the
geometric product space of two dimensions, which allows us to export GA
operations to other algebras and vice-versa. Our construction supports a variety
of applications, from homomorphic obfuscation to general-purpose FHE
computations.

Year: 2019

Flexible magnetic small-scale robots use patterned magnetization to achieve fast
transformation into complex three-dimensional (3D) shapes and thereby achieve
locomotion capabilities and functions. These capabilities address current
challenges for microrobots in drug delivery, object manipulation, and minimally
invasive procedures. However, possible microrobot designs are limited by the
existing methods for patterning magnetic particles in flexible materials. Here,
we report a method for patterning hard magnetic microparticles in an elastomer
matrix. This method, based on ultraviolet (UV) lithography, uses controlled
reorientation of magnetic particles and selective exposure to UV light to encode
magnetic particles in planar materials with arbitrary 3D orientation with a
geometrical feature size as small as 100 micrometers. Multiple planar
microrobots with various sizes, different geometries, and arbitrary
magnetization profiles can be fabricated from a single precursor in one process.
Moreover, a 3D magnetization profile allows higher-order and multi-axis bending,
large-angle bending, and combined bending and torsion in one sheet of polymer,
creating previously unachievable shape changes and microrobotic locomotion
mechanisms such as multi-arm power grasping and multi-legged paddle crawling. A
physics-based model is also presented as a design tool to predict the shape
changes under magnetic actuation.

Year: 2019

Mesoscale electromechanical systems find applications in fields such as medical
instrumentation, soft robotics, microscopy, flexible electronics, and imaging.
This paper implements the printed circuit MEMS (PC-MEMS) process for the
fabrication of a ‘pop-up’ flexure-based mesoscale system that exploits the
simplicity of 2-D manufacturing techniques such as sheet-metal operations and
laser cutting to realize a 3-D mechanism. The fabrication of a laminated Delta
robot with prismatic actuation is presented to exemplify this process. A working
device with actuation and functional components such as linear guides, stepper
motors, and limit switches is designed and fully realized. Because the mechanism
is popped out of the plane to achieve its 3D shape, we present a stiffness
analysis to arrive at the out-of-plane (or ‘pop-out’) angles that the planar
system must accommodate so that constraints/limits on actuator torque/force can
be satisfied while producing an operational system. The simplicity of the
processes makes it a candidate for use in the emerging open-source hardware
technologies for fabricating low-cost, complex, electromechanical systems.

Year: 2019

For soft robots to have ubiquitous adoption in practical applications they
require soft actuators that provide well-rounded actuation performance that
parallels natural muscle while being inexpensive and easily fabricated. This
manuscript introduces a toolkit to rapidly prototype, manufacture, test, and
power various designs of hydraulically amplified self-healing electrostatic
(HASEL) actuators with muscle-like performance that achieve all three basic
modes of actuation (expansion, contraction, and rotation). This toolkit utilizes
easy-to-implement methods, inexpensive fabrication tools, commodity materials,
and off-the-shelf high-voltage electronics thereby enabling a wide audience to
explore HASEL technology. Remarkably, the actuators created from this easy-to-
implement toolkit achieve linear strains exceeding 100%, a specific power
greater than 150 W kg−1, and ≈20% strain at frequencies above 100 Hz. This
combination of large strain, extreme speed, and high specific power yields soft
actuators that jump without power-amplifying mechanisms. Additionally, an
efficient fabrication technique is introduced for modular designs of HASEL
actuators, which is used to develop soft robotic devices driven by portable
electronics. Inspired by the versatility of elephant trunks, the above
capabilities are combined to create an untethered continuum robot for grasping
and manipulating delicate objects, highlighting the wide potential of the
introduced methods for soft robots with increasing sophistication.

Year: 2018

This paper evaluates how laminated techniques may be used to replicate the
performance of more traditionally manufactured robotic manipulators. In this
case study, we introduce a laminated 2-DOF spherical, parallel manipulator.
Taking advantage of laminating techniques in the construction of the robot can
result in considerable savings in construction costs and time, but the
challenges caused by this technique have to be addressed. By using stiffer
materials in rigid links, the rigidity of the robot is increased to an
acceptable level. We discuss one method for compensating position uncertainty
via an experimental identification technique which uses a neural network to
create a forward kinematic model. Final results show that the proposed mechanism
is able to track desired rotation with acceptable precision using open-loop
model-based control. This indicates that parallel manipulators fabricated using
lamination techniques can provide similar performance with prototypes made in
conventional methods.

Year: 2018

Wider use and adaptation of microfluidics is hindered by the infrastructure,
knowledge, and time required to build prototype systems, especially when
multiple fluid operations and measurements are required. As a result, 3D
printing of microfluidics is attracting interest, yet cannot readily achieve the
feature size, smoothness, and optical transparency needed for many standard
microfluidic systems. Herein we present a new approach to the design and
construction of high-precision modular microfluidics, using standard injection-
molded blocks that are modified using micromilling and assembled via elastically
averaged contacts. Desktop micromilling achieves channel dimensions as small as
50 μm depth and 150 μm width and adhesive films seal channels to allow internal
fluid pressure of >400 kPa. Elastically averaged connections between bricks
result in a mechanical locating repeatability of ~1 μm, enabling fluid to pass
between bricks via an O-ring seal with >99.9% reliability. We demonstrated and
tested block-based systems for generating droplets at rates above 9000 min−1 and
COV <3%, and integrated optical sensors. We also show how blocks can be used to
build easily reconfigurable interfaces with glass microfluidic devices and
imaging hardware. Microfluidic bricks fabricated by FDM and SLA 3D printing
cannot achieve the dimensional quality of molded bricks, yet 3D printing allows
customized bricks to be integrated with standard LEGOs. Our approach enables a
wide variety of modular microfluidic units to be built using a widely available,
cost-effective platform, encouraging use in both research and education.

Keywords: high-dimensional data, proximity search, k-nearest neighbor graph, index optimization, graph-based methods
Year: 2018

Searching for high-dimensional vector data with high accuracy is an inevitable
search technology for various types of data. Graph-based indexes are known to
reduce the query time for high-dimensional data. To further improve the query
time by using graphs, we focused on the indegrees and outdegrees of graphs.
While a sufficient number of incoming edges (indegrees) are indispensable for
increasing search accuracy, an excessive number of outgoing edges (outdegrees)
should be suppressed so as to not increase the query time. Therefore, we propose
three degree-adjustment methods: static degree adjustment of not only outdegrees
but also indegrees, dynamic degree adjustment with which outdegrees are
determined by the search accuracy users require, and path adjustment to remove
edges that have alternative search paths to reduce outdegrees. We also show how
to obtain optimal degree-adjustment parameters and that our methods outperformed
previous methods for image and textual data.

As additive manufacturing (AM) advances rapidly towards new materials and
applications, it is vital to understand the performance limits of AM
technologies and to overcome these limits via improved machine design and
process integration. Extrusion-based AM (i.e., fused filament fabrication, FFF)
is compatible with a wide variety of thermoplastic polymer and composite
materials, and can be deployed across a wide range of length scales. However,
the build rate of both desktop and professional FFF systems is comparable (∼10’s
of cm3/h at ∼0.2 mm layer thickness), suggesting that fundamental aspects of the
machine design and process physics limit system performance. We determine the
rate limits to FFF by analysis of machine modules: the filament extrusion
mechanism, the heater and nozzle, and the motion system. We determine, by direct
measurements and numerical analysis, that FFF build rate is influenced by the
coincident module-level limits to traction force exerted on the filament,
conduction heat transfer to the filament core, and gantry velocity for
positioning the printhead. Our findings are validated by direct measurements of
build rate versus part complexity using desktop FFF systems. Last, we study the
scaling of the rate limits using finite element simulations of thermoplastic
flow through the extruder. We map the scaling of extrusion force, polymer exit
temperature, and average printhead velocity onto a unifying trade-space of build
rate versus resolution. This approach validates the build rate performance of
current FFF systems, and suggests that significant enhancements in FFF build
rate with targeted quality specifications are possible via mutual improvements
to the extrusion and heating mechanism along with high-speed motion systems.

A method is presented for the reduction of morphologically detailed microcircuit
models to a point-neuron representation without human intervention. The
simplification occurs in a modular workflow, in the neighborhood of a user-
specified network activity state for the reference model, the 'operating point'.
First, synapses are moved to the soma, correcting for dendritic filtering by
low-pass filtering the delivered synaptic current. Filter parameters are
computed numerically and independently for inhibitory and excitatory input using
a Green’s function approach. Next, point-neuron models for each neuron in the
microcircuit are fit to their respective morphologically detailed counterparts.
Here, generalized integrate-and-fire point neuron models are used, leveraging a
recently published fitting toolbox. The fits are constrained by currents and
voltages computed in the morphologically detailed partner neurons with soma
corrected synapses at three depolarizations about the user specified operating
point. The result is a simplified circuit which is well constrained by the
reference circuit, and can be continuously updated as the latter iteratively
integrates new data. The modularity of the approach makes it applicable also for
other point-neuron and synapse models. The approach is demonstrated on a
recently reported reconstruction of a neocortical microcircuit around an in
vivo-like working point.

Experimental methods in neuroscience, such as calcium-imaging and recordings

into the simultaneous activity of large numbers of neurons, and into plasticity
processes in the brains of awake and behaving animals. These new data constrain
models for neural computation and network plasticity that underlie perception,
cognition, behavior, and learning. I will discuss in this short article four
such constraints: Inherent recurrent network activity and heterogeneous dynamic
properties of neurons and synapses, stereotypical spatio-temporal activity
patterns in networks of neurons, high trial-to-trial variability of network
responses, and functional stability in spite of permanently ongoing changes in
the network. I am proposing that these constraints provide hints to underlying
principles of brain computation and learning.

Year: 2016

The handheld micropipette is the most ubiquitous instrument for precision
handling of microliter-milliliter liquid volumes, which is an essential
capability in biology and chemistry laboratories. The range of one pipette is
typically adjustable up to 10-fold its minimum volume, requiring the use and
maintenance of multiple pipettes for liquid handling across larger ranges. Here
we propose a design for a single handheld pipette adjustable from 0.1 µl to 1000
µl (i.e., 104-fold) which spans the range of an entire suite of current
commercial pipettes. This is accomplished by placing an elastic diaphragm
between the existing pipette body and tip, thereby de-amplifying its native
volume range while maintaining its simple manual operating procedure. For proof-
of-concept, we adapted a commercial pipette (100–1000 µl nominal range) with a
selection of rubber sheets to function as the diaphragms and confirmed the
accuracy and precision of drawn volumes are within international ISO-8655
standards across the entire 104-fold volume range. The presence of the
diaphragms introduces a nonlinear mechanical behavior and a time-dependency due
to heat transfer, however, by model and experiment, these are redressed so as to
maintain the pipette’s accuracy and precision.

## A framework for teaching the fundamentals of additive manufacturing and enabling rapid innovation

Jamison Go, A. John Hart

Category: other
Keywords: Education, Teaching, Design, Laboratory, Project
Year: 2016

The importance of additive manufacturing (AM) to the future of product design
and manufacturing infrastructure demands educational programs tailored to
embrace its fundamental principles and its innovative potential. Moreover, the
breadth and depth of AM spans several traditional disciplines, presenting a
challenge to instructors, along with the opportunity to integrate knowledge via
creative and demanding projects. This paper presents our approach to teaching AM
at the graduate and advanced undergraduate level, in the form of a 14-week
course developed and taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The
lectures begin with in-depth technical analysis of the major AM processes and
machine technologies, then focus on special topics including design methods,
machine controls, applications of AM to major industry needs, and emerging
processes and materials. In lab sessions, students operate and characterize
desktop AM machines, and work in teams to design and fabricate a bridge having
maximum strength per unit weight while conforming to geometric constraints. The
class culminates in a semester-long team design-build project. In a single
semester of the course, teams created prototype machines for 3D printing of
molten glass, 3D printing of soft-serve ice cream, robotic deposition of
biodegradable material, direct-write deposition of continuous carbon fiber
composites, large-area parallel extrusion of polymers, and in situ optical
scanning during 3D printing. Several of these projects led to patent
applications, follow-on research, and peer-reviewed publications. We conclude
that AM education, while arguably rooted in mechanical engineering, is truly
multidisciplinary, and that education programs must embrace this context. We
also comment on student feedback, our experience as instructional staff, and our
adaptation of this course to a manufacturing-focused master’s degree program and
a one-week professional short program.

## Facilitating Deployable Mechanisms and Structures Via Developable Lamina Emergent Arrays

Category: other

Year: 2016

A method is presented utilizing networks of lamina emergent joints, known as
lamina emergent arrays, to accommodate large-curvature developable structures
suited to deployable applications. By exploiting the ruling lines in developable
surfaces, this method enables developable structures and mechanisms that can be
manufactured with two-dimensional geometry and yet have a greater range of
elastic motion than is possible with a solid sheet of material. Aligning the
joints to the ruling lines also biases the structure to a specific deployment
path. A mathematical model is developed to describe the resulting stiffness of
the structure employing the lamina emergent arrays and equations are derived to
facilitate stress analysis of the structure. Finite element results show the
sensitivity of alignment of the elements in the array to the stress present in
the developed structure. A specific technique for creating an array pattern for
conical developable surfaces is described. Examples of developable structures
and mechanisms, including curved-fold origami models transitioned to thick
materials and two origami-inspired mechanisms, are examined.

A cellular automaton collider is a finite state machine built of rings of one-
dimensional cellular automata. We show how a computation can be performed on the
collider by exploiting interactions between gliders (particles, localisations).
The constructions proposed are based on universality of elementary cellular
automaton rule 110, cyclic tag systems, supercolliders, and computing on rings.

Year: 2015

Distributed systems are difficult to implement correctly because they must
handle both concurrency and failures: machines may crash at arbitrary points and
networks may reorder, drop, or duplicate packets. Further, their behavior is
often too complex to permit exhaustive testing. Bugs in these systems have led
to the loss of critical data and unacceptable service outages. We present Verdi,
a framework for implementing and formally verifying distributed systems in Coq.
Verdi formalizes various network semantics with different faults, and the
developer chooses the most appropriate fault model when verifying their
implementation. Furthermore, Verdi eases the verification burden by enabling the
developer to first verify their system under an idealized fault model, then
transfer the resulting correctness guarantees to a more realistic fault model
without any additional proof burden. To demonstrate Verdi’s utility, we present
the first mechanically checked proof of linearizability of the Raft state
machine replication algorithm, as well as verified implementations of a primary-
backup replication system and a key-value store. These verified systems provide
similar performance to unveriﬁed equivalents.

## Millions of Little Minions: Using Packets for Low Latency Network Programming and Visibility

Category: other
Keywords: Active Networks, SDN, Software-Defined Networks, Network Architecture, Switch ASIC Design
Year: 2014

This paper presents a practical approach to rapidly introducing new dataplane
functionality into networks: End-hosts embed tiny programs into packets to
actively query and manipulate a network’s internal state. We show how this “tiny
packet program” (TPP) interface gives end-hosts unprecedented visibility into
network behavior, enabling them to work with the network to achieve a desired
functionality. Our design leverages what each component does best: (a) switches
forward and execute tiny packet programs (at most 5 instructions) in-band at
line rate, and (b) end-hosts perform arbitrary (and easily updated) computation
on network state. By implementing three different research proposals, we show
that TPPs are useful. Using a hardware prototype on a NetFPGA, we show our
design is feasible at a reasonable cost.

## Extensible-Link Kinematic Model for Characterizing and Optimizing Compliant Mechanism Motion

Justin Beroz, Shorya Awtar, A. John Hart

Category: other
Keywords: compliant mechanism, accuracy, path generation, flexure, microgripper, topology optimization, extensible-link, kinematic model, load dependency
Year: 2014

We present an analytical model for characterizing the motion trajectory of an
arbitrary planar compliant mechanism. Model development consists of identifying
particular material points and their connecting vectorial lengths in a manner
that represents the mechanism topology; whereby these lengths may extend over
the course of actuation to account for the elastic deformation of the compliant
mechanism. The motion trajectory is represented within the model as an
analytical function in terms of these vectorial lengths, whereby its Taylor
series expansion constitutes a parametric formulation composed of load-
independent and load-dependent terms. This adds insight to the process for
designing compliant mechanisms for high-accuracy motion applications because:
(1) inspection of the load-independent terms enables determination of specific
topology modifications that reduce or eliminate certain error components of the
motion trajectory; and (2) the load-dependent terms reveal the polynomial orders
of principally uncorrectable error components in the trajectory. The error
components in the trajectory simply represent the deviation of the actual motion
trajectory provided by the compliant mechanism compared to the ideally desired
one. A generalized model framework is developed, and its utility demonstrated
via the design of a compliant microgripper with straight-line parallel jaw
motion. The model enables analytical determination of all geometric
modifications for minimizing the error trajectory of the jaw, and prediction of
the polynomial order of the uncorrectable trajectory components. The jaw
trajectory is then optimized using iterative finite elements simulations until
the polynomial order of the uncorrectable trajectory component becomes apparent;
this reduces the error in the jaw trajectory by 2 orders of magnitude over the
prescribed jaw stroke. This model serves to streamline the design process by
identifying the load-dependent sources of trajectory error in a compliant
mechanism, and thereby the limits with which this error may be redressed by
topology modification.

## Density-Based Clustering Based on Hierarchical Density Estimates

Category: other
Keywords: density-based clustering, hierarchical clustering, cluster stability, data mining, algorithm
Year: 2013

We propose a theoretically and practically improved density-based, hierarchical
clustering method, providing a clustering hierarchy from which a simplified tree
of significant clusters can be constructed. For obtaining a 'flat' partition
consisting of only the most significant clusters (possibly corresponding to
different density thresholds), we propose a novel cluster stability measure,
formalize the problem of maximizing the overall stability of selected clusters,
and formulate an algorithm that computes an optimal solution to this problem. We
demonstrate that our approach outperforms the current, state-of-the-art,
density-based clustering methods on a wide variety of real world data.

## Incremental Inspection for Microrobotic Quality Assurance

Category: other
Keywords: microrobots, manufacturing, quality control, assembly, inspection
Year: 2013

This paper addresses inspection techniques that can be performed by microrobots
used for fabricating three-dimensional structures. In contrast to most
commercial rapid prototyping processes, the parallelism afforded by microrobot
teams allows incremental inspection of structures during assembly. In the
present case, this approach is applied to parts fabricated from carbon fiber
struts bonded with UV-cured epoxy. Preliminary tests involving thermal and
vibrational inspection methods are described and compared with the results of
FEA models of the joints. Vibrational inspection performed by microrobots and
recorded using a directional microphone characterizes bond joint natural
frequency with good resolution (an average measurement standard deviation of 5Hz
over a range of 650-1215 Hz). These effective stiffness measurements are
correlated with ultimate bond strength as well. The measurements are sufficient
to distinguish between joints that do or do not have desired amounts of
adhesive.

## On Soliton Collisions between Localizations in Complex Elementary Cellular Automata: Rules 54 and 110 and Beyond

Genaro J. Martínez, Andrew Adamatzky, Fangyue Chen, Leon Chua

Category: other
Keywords: cellular automata, soliton, self-localization, elementary cellular automata, complex systems
Year: 2012

In this paper, a single-soliton two-component cellular automaton (CA) model of
waves is presented as mobile self-localizations, also known as particles, waves,
or gliders, in addition to its version with memory. The model is based on coding
sets of strings where each chain represents a unique mobile self-localization.
The original soliton models in CAs proposed with filter automata are briefly
discussed, followed by solutions in elementary CAs (ECAs) domain with the famous
universal ECA rule 110, and reporting a number of new solitonic collisions in
ECA rule 54. A mobile self-localization in this study is equivalent to a single
soliton because the collisions of the mobile self-localizations studied in this
paper satisfy the property of solitonic collisions. A specific ECA with memory
(ECAM), the ECAM rule fR9maj:4, is also presented; it displays single-soliton
solutions from any initial codification (including random initial conditions)
for a kind of mobile self-localization because such an automaton is able to
adjust any initial condition to soliton structures.

## Large-scale neural dynamics: Simple and complex

Category: other
Keywords: neural field models, brain modeling, EEG, fMRI, MEG, optical imaging, neural dynamics, spatio-temporal patterns
Year: 2010

We review the use of neural field models for modelling the brain at the large
scales necessary for interpreting EEG, fMRI, MEG, and optical imaging data.
Albeit a framework that is limited to coarse-grained or mean-field activity,
neural field models provide a framework for unifying data from different imaging
modalities. Starting with a description of neural mass models, we build to
spatially extended cortical models of layered two-dimensional sheets with long-
range axonal connections mediating synaptic interactions. Reformulations of the
fundamental non-local mathematical model in terms of more familiar local
differential (brain wave) equations are described. Techniques for the analysis
of such models, including how to determine the onset of spatio-temporal pattern-
forming instabilities, are reviewed. Extensions of the basic formalism to treat
refractoriness, adaptive feedback, and inhomogeneous connectivity are described
along with open challenges for the development of multi-scale models that can
integrate macroscopic models at large spatial scales with models at the
microscopic scale.

## Dependence Minimizing Regression with Model Selection for Non-Linear Causal Inference under Non-Gaussian Noise

Makoto Yamada, Masashi Sugiyama

Category: other
Keywords: causal inference, non-linear causal relationship, non-Gaussian noise, least-squares independence regression, model selection
Year: 2010

The discovery of non-linear causal relationship under additive non-Gaussian
noise models has attracted considerable attention recently because of their high
flexibility. In this paper, we propose a novel causal inference algorithm called
least-squares independence regression (LSIR). LSIR learns the additive noise
model through minimization of an estimator of the squared-loss mutual
information between inputs and residuals. A notable advantage of LSIR over
existing approaches is that tuning parameters such as the kernel width and the
regularization parameter can be naturally optimized by cross-validation,
allowing us to avoid overfitting in a data-dependent fashion. Through
experiments with real-world datasets, we show that LSIR compares favorably with
the state-of-the-art causal inference method.

Keywords: literature, perception, psychophysics, hermeneutics, reader response
Year: 2007

This paper presents the results of experiments made within the interdisciplinary
project between the Department for Comparative Literature at the University of
Tübingen and Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics. We examined the
following three questions using both psychophysical and structuralistic-
hermeneutical methods: a) Are there regularities in the judgments of spatial
descriptions by different readers? b) Do readers encode the perceptual
perspective of characters during reading? c) Are there correspondences between
foregrounding effects and the physiological reaction (galvanic skin response) of
readers? The results show that a) the semantic validation of spatial
descriptions showed high homogeneity; b) the method actually showed more about
literary strategies concerning object occluding and required the development of
new experiment approaches to identify the perspective taken by the reader, that
c) the emotional response is quite idiosyncratic but can be roughly divided into
two schemes (high or low response).

## High Performance RDMA Protocols in HPC

Keywords: RDMA, HPC, network interconnects, performance, pipeline protocol
Year: 2006

Modern network interconnects that leverage Remote Directory Memory Access (RDMA)
and OS bypass, such as Infiniband, Myrinet, and iWARP over TCP, can offer
significant performance advantages over conventional send/receive network
semantics. However, the high performance of RDMA often comes with hidden costs.
RDMA based interconnects generally fail to provide true one-sided semantics,
requiring an exchange of information prior to initiating a one-sided RDMA
operation. In addition, both the initiator and target must typically preserve
the physical to virtual memory mappings during the RDMA operation. This paper
describes a unique user-level ‘pipeline’ protocol that addresses these
constraints while avoiding some of the pitfalls of existing techniques. By
effectively overlapping the cost of memory registration with RDMA operations,
this protocol provides good performance even in the absence of memory buffer
reuse. This protocol may also take advantage of memory buffers that have already
been used in RDMA operations by avoiding the cost of memory registration.
Through this approach, bandwidth may be increased up to 67% when memory buffers
are not effectively reused while providing performance equal to that of existing
techniques as demonstrated by both Linpack and NPB benchmark results. Several
user level protocols are explored using Open MPI’s PML (Point to point messaging
layer) and compared/contrasted to this ‘pipeline’ protocol.

## Design of Large-Displacement Compliant Joints

Brian P. Trease, Yong-Mo Moon, Sridhar Kota

Category: other
Keywords: compliant joints, flexure connectors, range of motion, axis drift, off-axis stiffness, stress concentration
Year: 2005

This paper investigates the drawbacks of typical flexure connectors and presents
several new designs for highly effective, kinematically well-behaved compliant
joints. A revolute and a translational compliant joint are proposed, both of
which offer great improvements over existing flexures in the qualities of (1) a
large range of motion, (2) minimal 'axis drift,' (3) increased off-axis
stiffness, and (4) reduced stress concentrations. Analytic stiffness equations
are developed for each joint and parametric computer models are used to verify
their superior stiffness properties. A catalog of design charts based on the
parametric models is also presented, allowing for rapid sizing of the joints for
custom performance. A joint range of motion has been calculated with finite
element analysis, including stress concentration effects.
