# OCR and LLMs

# LLMs / VLMs Have been Eating Machine Learning

- tasks that used to require extensive, specialized training...
- ... are now handled by foundation models
- ... or with minimal fine tuning

# Foundation Models

- self-supervised training on vast amounts of unlabeled data (images, text)
- multitask learning
- task specifications in natural language
- generalization to new tasks and classes through natural language

# Example: Abstract Categorization

TODO

# Zero/Few Shot with LLMs

- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Document Categorization
- Sentiment Analysis
- Text Summarization
- Machine Translation
- ...

# Zero/Few Shot with VLMs

- Object Recognition/Classification
- Object Detection
- Scene Understanding
- Action Recognition
- ...

# Require Specialized Custom Models

- Photometric Stereo
- Gaze Estimation
- Anomaly Detection
- 3D Pose Estimation for Articulated Objects
- ...

# Where does OCR Fit In?

# What is Happening in OCR

- traditional conversion systems
- "OCR-free" OCR systems

# More on OCR Developments

# NVIDIA OCR Efforts and Foundation Models

# Required vs Actual Error Rates

# Language Model Hallucinations / Corrections

# What are the Use Cases?

- used to be search and retrieval, reformatting
- these days: training, RAG, LLM analysis, information extraction, question answering
- conversion still matters though

# Data Sources for OCR Training and Applications

# Do We Still Need Scanned Book Conversions?

# Paperless Is Here

# The PDF / Word / XML / Microformat / Microdata Mess

- PDF has no standard semantic labeling
- semantic data in PDF via embedded XML
- LaTeX can't produce tagged PDF

# Data Sources as LLM Inputs?

# PyMuPDF + ChatGPT

# OCRBench Tasks

# What does Knowledge Look Like?

# LLM Book Derived Knowledge vs Actual Knowledge

# Wikidata Claims

# Efficiency of Natural Language

# RDF Triples

# Logical Inference in LLMs?

# Attempts: Integrate Knowledge Graphs into LLMs

# Classical Problem: Term Resolution

# Classical Problem: Disambiguation
